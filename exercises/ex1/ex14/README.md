# Exercise 1.4 - Import and deploy the provided script collection

In Cloud Integration, it is possible to bundle scripts in a script collection that can be shared across different integration flows and APIs. We have prepared such a script collection with scripts that will be used within the REST API implementation. You just need to upload and deploy the collection.

## Exercise steps

Run through the following steps.
1. If you are not already in, switch to the *Design* area and enter your package **Teched 2021 Exercise XX** again with **XX** the participant number assigned to you
2. In the package, switch to *Edit* mode
3. Select menu *Add --> Script Collection*
4. In the upcoming dialog, switch to the *Upload* radio button, then select *Browse*
5. Navigate to the **Integration Artifacts** folder of your beforehand downloaded tutorial material, and select the **Scripting - Script Collection XX.zip** file, then click on *OK*
6. You should see the script collection in the list of your artifacts
7. From the action menu of the script collection, select *Deploy*
8. Like you did for the message mapping, we will navigate to the Operations view to ensure that the artifact has been successfully deployed. Select entry *Monitor* from the navigation pane.
9. In the Monitor, select the *Script Collection* tile below the *Manage Integration Content* section
10. Search for your participant number. After a while the status of your script collection will turn from Starting into **Started**
