# Exercise 1 - Create re-usable artifacts

In the first part of the tutorial, you will create re-usable artifacts in Cloud Integration that you will use within your REST API implementation in the second part of the tutorial.

## Open Cloud Integration Web UI

In exercises 1 and 2, we will work within the Cloud Integration Web UI to design, develop and operate integration scenarios. So, let's open the Web UI.
1. Open the SAP Integration Suite landing page (see system and logon information provided to you)
1. Logon with the user and password provided to you
1. On the landing page, select the Cloud Integration tile to open the Cloud Integration Web UI

## Run through the Exercise 1 steps

This part of the tutorial can be divided into the following chapters:

### [Create a re-usable message mapping](exercises/ex1/ex11)
Within the integration package assigned to you, create a re-usable message mapping to map from XML to JSON.

### [Test your message mapping](exercises/ex1/ex12)
Optionally, test your message mapping using the simulation capability inside the message mapping editor.

### [Deploy your message mapping](exercises/ex1/ex13)
Before using the re-usable message mapping in an integration flow or API, it needs to be deployed on the runtime node.

### [Import and deploy a script collection](exercises/ex1/ex14)
Import a script collection that contains all Groovy scripts which are required within your API implementation. Then deploy it on the runtime node.

## Summary

At the end of the first part of the tutorial, you should have defined and deployed both a message mapping and a script collection.
