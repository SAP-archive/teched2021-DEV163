# Exercise 1.2 (Optional) - Simulate the message mapping

Since we will simulate the whole REST API in the second part of the tutorial anyway, this step can be done optionally.

## Exercise steps

If you like to simulate your beforehand created message mapping to ensure that it functions properly, proceed as follows. [See also video below](#Demo).
1. If you are still in the message mapping editor, click on the *Simulate* button.
2. In the upcoming dialog, select *Browse* to upload a sample input file
3. Navigate to the **Simulation** folder of the tutorial material, and select the XML file **SampleResponseFromSOAPService.xml**, then click on *Open*
4. You will see the sample file within the test input on the left. Click on *Test*
5. Once the mapping test has successfully run, you should see the test output on the right
6. Optionally, you can download the output and open the file with notepad. The mapped file should be in JSON format

## Demo

The video shows you all the steps described above. Best is to run the video by selecting **Open link in new tab** so that you can easily return to this page for further proceeding.
