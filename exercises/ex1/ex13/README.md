# Exercise 1.3 - Deploy the message mapping

Before using the re-usable message mapping in an integration flow or API, you need to deploy it.

## Exercise steps

Run through the following steps, **see also video below**.
1. If you are still in the message mapping editor, simply click on the *Deploy* button. Otherwise, on the *Artifacts* tab within your integration package, you can also select *Deploy* from the action menu of your message mapping artifact
2. Confirm the upcoming dialog if any
3. Switch to the Operations view by selecting the *Monitor* entry in the navigation pane
4. Below the *Manage Integration Content*, you will find a *Message Mapping* tile. Select the tile
5. In the Manage Integration Content monitor, search for your participant number. After a while, the status should change to **Started**

## Demo

The video shows you the steps described above. Best is to run the video by selecting **Open link in new tab** so that you can easily return to this page for further proceeding.
