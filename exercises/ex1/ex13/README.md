# Exercise 1.3 - Deploy the message mapping

Before using the re-usable message mapping in an integration flow or API, you need to deploy it.

## Exercise steps

Run through the following steps, [see also video below](#Demo).
1. If you are still in the message mapping editor, simply click on the *Deploy* button. Otherwise, on the *Artifacts* tab within your integration package, you can also select *Deploy* from the action menu of your message mapping artifact
2. Confirm the upcoming dialog if any
3. Switch to the Operations view by selecting the *Monitor* entry in the navigation pane
4. Below the *Manage Integration Content* section, select the *Message Mapping* tile. If the *Message Mapping* tile does not exist, you first need to add it by clicking on the *Plus* sign tile. In the upcoming tile settings dialog, select the *Message Mapping* artefact type, then click *OK*
5. In the Manage Integration Content monitor, search for your participant number. After a while, the status should change to **Started**

## Demo
