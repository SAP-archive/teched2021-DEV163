# Exercise 3 - Create an API proxy

In the third part of the tutorial, we will discover the APIs provided by the Cloud Integration tenant, so actually the end points of integration flows deployed on the Cloud Integration tenant, and generate API proxies for the same. This is supported for the adapter types OData, REST, and SOAP. In our case, we will create an API proxy for the RESTful service created before.

## Open API Portal

In exercise 3, we will work with the API Management service. So, let's open the API Portal.
1. Navigate to the SAP Integration Suite landing page by selecting the *Integration Suite* link in the top bar
1. On the landing page, select the *API Management* tile to open the API Portal
