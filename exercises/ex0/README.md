# Getting started

Before you start with the actual tutorial, run through the following preparation steps.

## Download the exercise material

Download and unzip the [attached tutorial material](/exercises/ex0/material/TutorialMaterial.zip).

Once you have unzipped the material file, you should see the following folders:
- **Integration Artifacts** - containing script collection as well as mapping source and target message format
- **Service Key** - containing runtime service key
- **Simulation** - containing sample input message

## System logon & user information

For running through the exercise steps, we will provide an SAP Integration Suite tenant. Tenant URL as well as user logon information will be provided to you during the hands-on session.

Each participant will get a participant number assigned to avoid any clashes. Use your participant number to uniquely define your integration artifacts.

## Summary

Now that you have run through the preparation, continue to - [Exercise 1](../ex1/README.md)
